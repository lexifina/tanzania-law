"""Build Tanzania's corpus from the cache only.

    python -X utf8 scripts/tanzania-law/parse.py

- corpus.json: the TanzLII acts (acts.json), through the shared Peachjam adapter (scripts/africa-law/peachjam.py,
  read-only; a byte-identical copy is kept in this folder so the repository ships the exact adapter it was built with),
  except the acts in UNVERIFIED below;
- corpus.d/50-unverified.json: those acts, whose newest archived version is not TanzLII's current expression (no
  .PUBLISH, so they reach the preview branch only).
- (planned, not written yet) corpus.d/10-constitution.json: the Constitution in English, from the official revised
  English version published by the Ministry of Constitutional and Legal Affairs (constitution.py); TanzLII has only the
  Kiswahili text.
Also writes verification.json (the checks) and repo/README.md, repo/LICENSE. Deterministic: same cache, same bytes.
